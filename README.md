### Just a simple readme, TL;DR friendly :D

This is all my Codeforces solution i've submitted (not all of this code are getting Accepted verdict, but more than 85% are solved). The topic is variative, like Dynamic Programming, Math, Greedy, Graph, and many more.

**Note : PLEASE DON'T JUST COPY PASTE THIS CODE! Understand the logic okay**
